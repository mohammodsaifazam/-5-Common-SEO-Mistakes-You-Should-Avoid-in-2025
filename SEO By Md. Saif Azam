Even great content can fail to rank without proper SEO. Here are 5 mistakes to watch out for:

1️⃣ Ignoring Technical SEO – Slow pages, broken links, and poor structure hurt rankings.
2️⃣ Keyword Stuffing – Write naturally; focus on search intent, not repetition.
3️⃣ Not Optimizing for Mobile – Mobile-first indexing is crucial; responsive design matters.
4️⃣ Skipping Analytics – Without tracking, you can’t measure success or improve.
5️⃣ Weak Backlink Strategy – Quality backlinks build authority; avoid spammy links.

Pro Tip: SEO success comes from strategy, consistency, and user experience. Focus on long-term growth, not shortcuts.
